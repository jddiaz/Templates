*Turn the phone off, then turn it back on, please.
*You will need to turn the phone off and back on, then make a call. If does not connect, wait a few minutes, then reboot the phone and try again.
*In this case I need to contact another department for assistance but before call them I need to get some information from your phone and from my system.
*In this case you will need to contact us from a different phone or from a computer because we need to work directly on the phone.
*I need the IMEI/MEID number from the new phone and the ZIP code where you are going to use the phone.
*The SIM card on this phone is expired son you cannot use it anymore. We can send you a new one so until you receive that you can activate the phone.
*Check if the Wi-Fi is off, the Airplane Mode off and the Cellular Data on, please.
*The situation here is that the plan you added is on the reserve. If you need the Hi-speed data back, we need to add now the plan but the service days you have left will be lost and you will not receive a refund or credit for the days you are not going to use.
*You cannot transfer the SIM card just like that. Your device is compatible with our company, the only thing you need to do is get the BYOP kit and you will get a SIM card that will be compatible with your phone.
