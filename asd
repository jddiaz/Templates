*Hi Customer.
*Can I get your phone number?
*Are you chatting from the phone?
I could not understand that perfectly.
*Could you be more specific?
*Can I get IMEI/MEID number from your phone?
*Can I get the e-mail address you have on the account?
*Can I get a 4-digit PIN you would like to use on your account?
*Checked the information on the account.
*The customer was chatting from the phone.
*Sure, let me help you with that.
*Is the phone from Straight Talk Wireless?
*You will receive an e-mail with a new password in a couple of minutes, then you can change it.
*In order to put the number on the other account we need to follow some security steps.
*You are welcome. Thank you for chatting with Straight Talk Wireless.
*Could you please provide me the...
Turn the phone off, wait two minutes, then turn it back on, please.
*You will need to turn the phone off and back on, then make a call. If does not connect, wait a few minutes, then reboot the phone and try again.
*In this case you will need to contact us from a different phone or from a computer because we need to work directly on the phone.
*I need the IMEI/MEID number from the new phone and the ZIP code where you are going to use the phone.
*The SIM card on this phone is expired son you cannot use it anymore. We can send you a new one so until you receive that you can activate the phone.
*Check if the Wi-Fi is off, the Airplane Mode off and the Cellular Data on, please.
*The situation here is that the plan you added is on the reserve. If you need the Hi-speed data back, we need to add now the plan but the service days you have left will be lost and you will not receive a refund or credit for the days you are not going to use.
You cannot transfer the SIM card just like that. Your device is compatible with our company, the only thing you need to do is get the BYOP kit and you will get a SIM card that will be compatible with your phone.


We are almost done! There are just a few more steps you need to follow to get your device(s) working: 
Please make sure your SIM card is inserted into your phone. 
Turn your phone OFF and back ON. 
Make a call. 
If the call does not connect, wait a few minutes, reboot your phone, and try again.
Once your new phone is active, you may receive a text message to update your data settings. If your data does not work, text APN to 611611. 
Note: In some instances, the data may take up to 30 minutes to work properly.
