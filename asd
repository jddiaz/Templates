*Can I get a 4-digit PIN you would like to use on your account?
*Can I get the last four digits of the IMEI number from the phone?
*Can I get the last four digits of the SIM card number from the phone?
*Could you please be more specific?
*Do you have the phone with you?
*Do you have an e-mail for the account?
*How many signal bars you have now?
*Checked the information on the account.
*Is the phone from Straight Talk Wireless?
*Is the SIM card you mentioned from the BYOP kit?
*You will receive an e-mail with a new password in a couple of minutes, then you can change it.
*Would you like to get a new number or transfer a number from another company?

*Check the information. SUI was correct.
*Check the information on the system.
*Let me transfer you to the Supervisor.
*Sure, let me help you with that.
*The customer was chatting from the phone.
*I could not understand that perfectly.
*You will need to turn the phone off and back on, then make a call. If does not connect, wait a few minutes, then reboot the phone and try again.
*In this case I need to contact another department for assistance but before call them I need to get some information from your phone and from my system.
*In this case you will need to contact us from a different phone or from a computer because we need to work directly on the phone.
*I need the IMEI/MEID number from the new phone and the ZIP code where you are going to use the phone.
*The SIM card on this phone is expired son you cannot use it anymore. We can send you a new one so until you receive that you can activate the phone.
*The situation here is that the plan you added is on the reserve. If you need the Hi-speed data back, we need to add now the plan but the service days you have left will be lost and you will not receive a refund or credit for the days you are not going to use.
*You cannot transfer the SIM card just like that. Your device is compatible with our company, the only thing you need to do is get the BYOP kit and you will get a SIM card that will be compatible with your phone.
